The chaos Computer Club Stuttgart has been hosting a series of monthly
talks for the last few years.

For each talks, we have to coordinate with the organisation team, the
speaker, create flyers and posters, update the website and then some.

This app aims to simplify the generation of the posters, flyers and
website.

It depends on:

    * [CairsoSVG](http://cairosvg.org/)
    * [qrcode](https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode)
    * [icalendar](https://github.com/collective/icalendar)
    * [xml_compare](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xml_compare) for the unittests

all are available in pypi.
